# First-step
Hi Santanu, Remember, this is the first day of your success. 
Do whatever it takes to be successful in life.
Always think before doing something.
Ask yourself, if you should do that to be happy.
Happyness, is not only the physical pleasure, Happyness is to find yourself. 
Happyness to is to know your purpose and fulfil your responsibilities. 
Happyness is to rediscover yourself from the illusions of this world. 
Happyness is to think rationally, asking the right question. 
Happyness is to defining the truth.
You will win. 
You have done it in past and you will do it once again and this time the best of you.
Good luck!
